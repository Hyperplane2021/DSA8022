```{r}
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the tweets

```{r}
tweets <- read.csv("TweetCorpusPolarity.csv")
tweets
```
Load the Ratings

```{r}
ratings <- read.csv("Ratings_WarrinerVAD.csv")
ratings
```

Split the tweets into words


```{r}
df <- unnest_tokens(tweets, "word", "Tweet")
df
```

Inner join with ratings

```{r}
joined <- inner_join(df, ratings, by = "word")
joined
```

Plot type requested is ambiguous - assuming faceted average for each dimension?

```{r}
reduced_df <- joined %>%
group_by(Polarity) %>%
summarise(
  valence = mean(Valence),
  arousal = mean(Arousal),
  dominance = mean(Dominance)
)
reduced_df
```
```{r}
tidy_df <- reduced_df %>% pivot_longer(cols = valence:dominance, names_to='Dimension',values_to = 'Mean')
tidy_df
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = tidy_df, aes(x = Dimension, y = Mean)) +
geom_col(aes(fill = Dimension)) +
facet_wrap(~ Polarity)
```
